<h2>Zombie Dogs</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect as many of the zombie dogs as possible in 40 seconds.  
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The players will experience a race against the clock to collect as many dogs before time runs out. 
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game falls in a puzzle and stragety gene
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
In this prototype the player can move left, right and jumping up. The main goal of the prototype is to smooth out the movement of the player.Also the zombie dogs which are falling from the sky is another key compent. They in this prototype give the player a goal and in future prototypes would be used similarly but on a bigger scale.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal was to evaluate the basic moving abilitys and timer abilities. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place on the quad of the phaser studios. In which the Phaser dude is casually strolling around on a beautiful spring day, until it starts raining ZOMBIE DOGS!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The Phaser dude must save the day from raining Zombie Dogs. The dogs he catches the better he does. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Bored people on the internet. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Each game lasts 40 seconds, but can be repeatedly played to improve on a previous best score. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Some strategies include jumping to reach the dogs at their highest points and moving to places where the dogs more concentrated.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I got the Phaser dude from: http://www.photonstorm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/dude.png
The grass and the sky I got of a basic google search and then croped them. 
The Zombie dog I got from: http://s47.photobucket.com/user/FatYogiX4/media/Sprite%20Stuffs/zombiedog.png.html  I then cropped out the first dog to use.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used stuff from a basic timed event along with influences from tanks, breakout and invaiders.
